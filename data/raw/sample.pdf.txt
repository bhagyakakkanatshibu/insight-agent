PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 
Data Scientist  
Robert Bosch China (BCSC), Wuxi, China | Mar 2022 - Dec 2024 
• 
Developed and deployed an NLP-based Proof of Concept for automated FMEA analysis, 
approved by Bosch top management; enabled predictive fault analysis and optimized 
testing resource allocation. 
• 
Led end-to-end data science and analytics projects as the single point of contact for stakeholders 
across departments 
• 
Conducted real-time analytics on Bosch’s Vehicle Data Lake using Python and Spark, identifying 
key failure mode correlations and fleet-level behavioral trends, enhancing fault prediction across 
multi-market operations. 
• 
Contributed to the development of a reinforcement learning-based self-calibration model for 
automotive control systems, improving adaptability and reducing manual tuning time across 
product lines. 
• 
Built and automated cloud-based CCU reporting pipelines leveraging Python, Tableau, Huawei 
Cloud, and Hadoop, reducing manual reporting time by over 60% and delivering stakeholder- 
ready insights weekly. 
• 
Led a data-driven cost-saving initiative by analyzing End-of-Line (EOL) test datasets, identifying 
redundant test parameters, and achieving estimated annual savings of ¥400,000 while 
maintaining predictive model performance. 
• 
Developed a PDF Analyzer tool utilizing NLP (spaCy, NLTK) to extract structured insights from 
unstructured engineering documents, reducing manual review time and accelerating validation 
decision-making processes.
